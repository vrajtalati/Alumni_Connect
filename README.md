# Alumni-Connect

Alumni-Connect addresses a common challenge faced by students in their job search journey - the effort and time spent in finding alumni for referrals. Traditionally, students invest a substantial amount of time scouring platforms like LinkedIn to connect with alumni, a prerequisite for seeking referrals.

Alumni-Connect streamlines this process by providing a comprehensive solution. Students can effortlessly search for alumni based on graduation year, name, or company name. This targeted search functionality significantly reduces search time, saving students up to 90% of the time typically spent on this task. By leveraging Alumni-Connect, students can swiftly connect with alumni, seeking mentorship or referrals with ease.
